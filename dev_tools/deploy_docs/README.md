# Overview

This is just a quick Go tool to upload my ccp markdown docs to my webserver with private key auth.

It uses:
- [github melbahja/goph](https://github.com/melbahja/goph) for ssh automation
- [github gleich/logoru](https://github.com/gleich/logoru) for terminal logging

To build this tool, `make build` and it will get all the required dependencies and compile them.

Run with `make build`

By default, you should see output like this...

```shell


```
